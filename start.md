Start
The fundamentals of software development are often overlooked.  In order to be great, you must focus on any obstacle than could potentially knock you out of a state of flow.  Regardless of your experience level, the best place to start is with a pencil and a notebook.  A physical notebook helps amplify actions that force you to hesitate.  These could be having to search the internet for information on design decisions to something so small that you may typically not even notice like deciding between private and static variables.  

Start small and force  yourself to write down anything you consciencly think about for 15 mins while writing code.  Don't be discouraged as it takes a lot of mental energy to slow yourself down and document.  If you pause for the same item multiple times, write it down multiple times.  At the end of this exercise, you should have at least 10-20 items for your list. 

Now is where the fun starts.  Take your items and see if you can put them into functional groups: IDE commands, Design Patterns, Coding Best Practices, etc.
