One of the most amazing things about software development is that there are levels of increasing challenge, yet you can produce value at all levels.  A fully functional application can be made by creating a single file of code with no design patterns.  All software engineers start out trying to figure out HOW to get something to work.  This is a great time to find what different areas and approaches fit in your brain.  One of the best exercises is to try and build the exact same application, but in totally different ways.  Searching "todo app" on google will result in tons of different demos that essentially build a very basic task list that someone can add items and check off completed items.  

The fundamentals of software development are often overlooked.  In order to be great, you must focus on any obstacle than could potentially knock you out of a state of flow.  Regardless of your experience level, the best place to start is with a pencil and a notebook.  A physical notebook helps amplify actions that force you to hesitate.  It could be having to search the internet for information on design decisions to something so small that you may typically not even notice like deciding between private and static variables.  

Start small and force  yourself to write down anything you consciencly think about while writing code.  Don't be discouraged as it takes a lot of mental energy to slow yourself down and document.  If you pause for the same item multiple times, write it down multiple times.  At the end of this exercise, you should have at least 10-20 items for your list. 

Now is where the fun starts.  Take your items and see if you can put them into functional groups: IDE commands, Design Patterns, Coding Best Practices, etc.  The way you interact with your keyboard, mouse and IDE are the most basic fundamentals and the most critical foundation.
